This movie was fantastic! The acting was superb and the plot kept me engaged throughout the entire film.
I couldn't stand this movie. The characters were poorly developed and the story made no sense at all.
A truly brilliant masterpiece with incredible cinematography and an emotional storyline.
This film was a complete waste of time. Boring plot, terrible dialogue, and awful special effects.
The director did an amazing job with this movie. The pacing was perfect and the ending was satisfying.
What a disappointment. The trailer promised so much but the movie failed to deliver on every level.
One of the best films I've seen this year. The performances were outstanding and the soundtrack was perfect.
Absolutely hated it. The movie dragged on forever and the ending was completely predictable.
This is a hidden gem! Great performances by the entire cast and a compelling story that keeps you guessing.
Don't waste your money on this terrible movie. The script was awful and the acting was even worse.
